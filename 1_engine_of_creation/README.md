Phase 1: Chaos
- High-entropy state. Nothing exists. Nothing interesting can possibly exist at this moment.

Phase 2: Fluctuations and First Automata
- Ephemeral pockets of low entropy form spontaneously. Simple automata come into being and thrive near them.
- As the pockets begin to diffuse, a stable zone happens to form nearby. "Life" is drawn towards it.

Phase 3: Paradigm Shift
- A mysterious shell structure emerges around the point of convergence.

Phase 4: Habitat
- Excess entropy is pumped out of the shell system. The shell stabilizes and matures into a self-sustaining entity.

Phase 5: Harmonic Synthesis
- Oscillatory movements in the all-nourishing shell construct a crude Hominid form.

Phase 6: Cartesian Refinement
- Finer details are sculpted into this form. All preparations are now complete.

Phase 7: Homeostasis
- The body comes to life. Internal environment further stabilizes, corporeal machinery kicks in.

Phase 8: Abstraction
- The mind comes to life. A sphere of perception forms and expands. At first, there is only chaos in it.
- As the mind develops and starts to grasp the world, structures start emerging inside.
- Cognitive revolution.
- Contemplation, reason, and examining the World and the Self.
- Glimpses of the Chief Engineer?
- Doubts, revaluation of knowledge, the quest for Truth, the method for reverse-engineering, and fascinating discoveries ...
- Of Nature's secret language.
- Of one's place in the living world.
- Of the depths of his own psyche.
- Of the computational universe.
