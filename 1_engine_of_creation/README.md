# Engine of Creation


### Phase 1: Chaos

- High-entropy state. Nothing exists. Nothing interesting *can* exist at the moment.


### Phase 2: Fluctuations and First Automata

- Pockets of low entropy appear spontaneously. Low-complexity automata emerge near them.
- As the pockets begin to diffuse, a stable zone happens to form nearby. "Life" is drawn towards it.


### Phase 3: Paradigm Shift

- A shell structure emerges around the point.


### Phase 4: Habitat

- Excess entropy is pumped out of the system. The shell stabilizes and matures into a self-sustaining entity.


### Phase 5: Harmonic Synthesis

- Oscillatory actions of the all-nourishing shell construct a crude Hominid form.


### Phase 6: Cartesian Refinement

- Finer details are sculpted into this form. All prepartions are now complete.


### Phase 7: Homeostasis

- The body comes to life. Internal environment further stabilizes, corporeal machinery kicks in.


### Phase 8: Abstraction

- The mind comes to life. A sphere of perception forms and expands. At first, there is only chaos in it. 
- As the mind starts to grasp the world, structures start emerging inside.
- Cognitive revolution.
- Contemplation, reason, and examining the world and the Self.
- Glimpses of the Chief Engineer?
- Doubts, revaluation of knowledge, the quest for Truth, the method, and fascinating discoveries ... 
- Of Nature's secret language.
- Of Man's place in the living world.
- Of the depths of his own psyche.
- Of the computational universe.
